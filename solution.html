                  <P>A full functioning web based e-learning system for the students to overcome obstacles of the education and to gain interest towards their studies. 
                      E-note learning system is a responsive web based system which is designed and developed for overcoming issues of traditional e-learning systems. 
                      Most e-Learning systems provide limited information using published documents in their database to e-learners. If a user wants to refer more than 
                      available documents to get more knowledge there is no certain process to satisfy that requirement. 
                      Current e-learning systems don’t give optimum solutions for this problem. From 'E-Note' learning system students can get knowledge 
                      not only from published documents but also can get information through the internet without reading and analyzing multiple websites.</p>
                      
                    <p>The product is designed and developed under four main components.</p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Content Curation</li>
                            <li>Text Summarization</li>
                            <li>Recommender system for self-evaluation</li>
                            <li>Ontology for real time Q&A</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Content Curation</b></p>

                    <p>Which is to sort through a large amount
                      of web content, find the best, most meaningful bits and to
                      present these in an organized way which enables effortless
                      extraction of relevant information, to collect information from
                      various sites and summarize the notes into one.</p>

                      <p><b>Text Summarization</b></p>
                      <p>Which simplifies content, lessening the
                        localization problem students face, minimize the time a
                        student spends on finding and summarizing notes across sites.</p>

                      <p><b>Recommender system for self-evaluation</b></p>
                      <p>Providing students with self-evaluation
                        option, with recommender system for questionnaire, not only
                        enabling the student to evaluate themselves, but to also be
                        presented with questions recommended to the user by the
                        system, that is identified by the system as difficult for the user.</p>

                          also be provided by the system. </P>

                <a>Why E-Note Learning System?</a>
              </h2>

              <div class="entry-content">
                <p>'E-Note' Learning System is designed and implemented based on the four main components. The components are independent from each other 
                    in a functional level leading to several advantages. The most specific advantage can be considered as Model Switching which is the 
                    ability to train the same model with an aid of a different dataset of the same type under a brief amount of time depending on the 
                    related audience and most importantly without affecting other components. This can be highlighted as one of the biggest loopholes 
                    in the prevailing solutions. With a feature like Model Switching, the value of the product can be raised quality wise and as well as commercially.</p>
                  
                 <p>Since 'E-Note' learning system is implemented as a web hosted software, it is convenient for the users to work from any remote location. 
                     For the users who do not have enough technical knowledge, it is easy to work with the product because of the user adaptive system design 
                     and the user friendly interfaces. This product is designed considering the modern industrial trends such as work from home and bring your 
                     own device (BYOD) adding more value to the product. </p>

              <div class="entry-content">
                <p>'E-Note' is a machine learning-based single integrated hybrid learning system which is developed to e-learning purposes. 
                    The system is developed using High-Level Microservice Architecture therefore it is independently deployable. 
                    Following the global data standards is one main reason why 'E-Note' is a commercially valuable product. 
                    With the novel and smart technologies used in implementing 'E-Note' over 90% of accuracy is achieved. 
                    Throughout the design and development phase a lot of attention was given to reduce the resource consumption rate. 
                    Therefore, 'E-Note' is a cost-effective solution for any organization. The system is designed with user-friendly 
                    interfaces and comprehensive functions which are easier to handle without much IT knowledge. Role-Based Access Control 
                    along with one way authentication is used to prevent the system and its data to maintain high-level authentication. 
                    The higher processing speed of E-Note Learning System provides the ability to process the information quickly and 
                    without doing it consciously.</p>

                 digital media is perceived to have many advantages and an increasing preference over traditional
                  education methods due to the improvements in the quality of education, the reduction in the cost
                  of education as well as the cost-effectiveness of the education, and the improvements in
                  accessibility to education and training.</p>
                  <p> Also given the current global and local CoVID19 pandemic situation,

                  <p>It is out of debate that the Financial Institutions need to have a system for students to do their work. Financial Institutions are dealing 
                      with the hard-earned money of the general public and they are even charging for that purpose. Therefore, it is a high
